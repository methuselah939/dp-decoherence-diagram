Abstract
This simulation maps the competing decoherence rates predicted by the Diósi–Penrose objective collapse model against standard environmental noise sources across a range of masses, temperatures, and vacuum pressures. It identifies the mesoscopic mass regime — approximately 10-14 kg — as the crossover point where gravitational decoherence becomes experimentally relevant. The goal is to provide an accessible visual tool for exploring where current experiments sit relative to this boundary and what conditions would be required to test it directly.
1. Introduction
The boundary between quantum and classical behavior remains one of the most significant open questions in physics. While environmental decoherence explains why large objects appear classical, it does not explain what physically enforces that transition. The Diósi–Penrose model proposes that gravity itself provides this mechanism, with collapse rates scaling quadratically with mass. This simulation visualizes where gravitational decoherence becomes competitive with environmental noise across a range of experimental conditions, identifying the mesoscopic mass regime as the most promising target for future experiments.
2. The Simulation
The interactive diagram models three decoherence rate profiles across a mass range of 10-22 to 10-13 kg for a silica nanosphere with density 2200 kg/m3 and a spatial superposition of 0.1 Å. The first panel plots the Diósi–Penrose gravitational rate against three environmental noise sources — gas collisions, blackbody emission, and photon scattering — across adjustable temperature and vacuum pressure conditions. The second panel maps which decoherence channel dominates across the full mass-temperature parameter space, revealing the boundary where gravitational collapse becomes relevant. The third panel traces the crossover curve where gravitational and environmental rates are equal, showing how that boundary shifts under different experimental conditions. Current experimental benchmarks from levitated nanoparticle and optomechanical experiments are marked for reference.
The Diósi–Penrose decoherence rate scales as:
Γ ~ GM²(Δx)² / (ħ R³)
where M is the mass of the system, Δx is the superposition width, R is the characteristic radius, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant. This quadratic mass dependence is what drives the crossover — at small masses the rate is negligible, but it accelerates rapidly as mass increases toward the mesoscopic scale.
3. Results
At standard temperatures and moderate vacuum conditions, environmental decoherence dominates across the entire mass range. As temperature decreases toward cryogenic levels and vacuum pressure approaches ultra-high vacuum conditions, a crossover region emerges in the mesoscopic mass range around 10-14 kg. At this scale, the quadratic mass scaling of the Diósi–Penrose rate becomes competitive with environmental noise for the first time.
The simulation identifies specific conditions under which gravitational decoherence would be the dominant channel — approximately 0.1 K and 10-13 mbar — consistent with parameters discussed in the experimental literature. At these conditions the predicted gravitational collapse time drops to approximately 1 millisecond.
The simulation does not confirm the Diósi–Penrose model. It maps the parameter space where the model makes testable predictions and where current and near-future experiments are most likely to find meaningful signal.
4. Conclusion
The quantum-to-classical transition remains experimentally unresolved. The Diósi–Penrose model offers a physically motivated and mathematically tractable proposal for how gravity might enforce classicality at the mesoscopic scale. This simulation provides a visual tool for exploring that proposal — mapping the parameter space where gravitational decoherence becomes relevant and where experiments might test it directly.
The mesoscopic mass regime around 10-14 kg under cryogenic ultra-high vacuum conditions represents the most promising experimental target. Current experiments in levitated optomechanics are approaching but have not yet reached this regime.
This simulation was developed as an independent exploratory tool. The author has no formal physics background. It is offered as a contribution to the conversation, not a conclusion to it.
